 The Machine Learning area has been growing a lot and aquiring many adepts, which makes increasingly more necessary to learn how to deal and treat the giant volume of data daily generated by diverse users around the world. Having all this mass of data in mind, it's necessary to know how to select the really relevant ones. To be able to better select this data there is the Feature Selection Process. This work shows a study about what is this process and how this process helps the Machine Learning problems, it also shows results that incetivate the use of these techniques. Finally, this work proposes the implementation of a service to select features in a datase using the feature selection models.
